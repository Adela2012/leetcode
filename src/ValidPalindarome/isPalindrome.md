Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example,
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
"race a car" is not a palindrome.

Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

验证回文字符串是比较常见的问题，所谓回文，就是一个正读和反读都一样的字符串，比如“level”或者“noon”等等就是回文串。非字母数字的字符.
